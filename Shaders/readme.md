## GLSugar - Shaders

Library of common shaders you might want.  Under construction.

.glsl means a standalone function you can call from anywhere.  .vert or .frag means it is a "main" shader.

Right now there's no automatic "glue" included.  Including the files as raw strings or a include system, etc. is user code responsibility.  These are just the source files for now.
